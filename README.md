## Before we proceed we have to define what a website is and how it differentiates between a web application.

To begin the development of a web application we must first understand the difference between a web application vs website is. A website is a collection of pages that provide information to the end users, to enter a website one searches it up using the website name or an URL. Websites are separated into two categories; *Dynamic Websites* and *Static Websites*. 

***Dynamic Websites*** : Dynamic websites are able to change their layout base on the users need, this websites typically required lots of user interaction. The interaction is not as obvious but users are able to interact with databases in real time. Examples of this websites are Facebook, Amazon or CNN

***Static Websites***: Static Websites on the other hand are more fixed with its contents, they donâ€™t have the interactivity that Dynamic websites have which also makes them easier to develop and to deploy. Examples of Static Websites are blogs, small business and online portfolios.

**Conclusion**: Now that we have establish the definition of a website we must now ask ourselves what are web applications? Web applications are computer programs that are then access through the the internet, this means that web applications function on a client-server relationship. Web applications are highly customizable, they can do more tasks then typical websites such as creating documents, managing projects and sending emails.
